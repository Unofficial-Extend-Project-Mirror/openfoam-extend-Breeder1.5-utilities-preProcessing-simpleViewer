simpleViewer - a graphical blockMesh previewer
=============================================

1. Introduction.

simpleViewer is a tool for viewing the block structure used by blockMesh
to create OpenFOAM meshes. It is written using the Fox toolkit and
OpenGL, and is basically a layer of code on top of blockMesh to do 
the graphics. At startup it reads in the blockMeshDict (it will read in
an incomplete blockMeshDict), displays the vertices (numbered) and edges 
(including curved edges) in an OpenGL window, together with a set of 
coordinate axes (in red - currently there is no scale on these, but they
do intersect at the origin (0,0,0) of the coordinate system).
The view can be zoomed (central button/wheel), translated (right button) 
or rotated (left button), and switched between parallel and perspective 
views (on the Actions menu). A second button will do a screendump to
a file "snapshot.gif".

2. Installation of Fox toolkit. 

simpleViewer is written using fox-1.6.34; it may compile using later versions
(I don't know). Download this from the Fox toolkit web site:

www.fox-toolkit.org

Unpack the toolkit somewhere convenient (I like to put it in /ThirdParty)
./configure -prefix ~/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty/fox-1.6.34
make
make install

3. Compiling simpleViewer

Unpack the directory somewhere appropriate. The code is a
standard OpenFOAM code with a subdirectory Make. Check the options file;
EXE_INC should point to the /include subdirectory of your Fox installation,
and EXE_LIBS should point to the /src subdirectory of the installation.
Having done this, wmake it in the usual way.

4. Using it.

Same as always; type

simpleViewer

5. To do.

This is a trial release, in the hope that some people might find it
useful (and to get feedback on the code). It is useable (I think) as
a way of looking at the blocks in a blockMeshDict. I'm hoping to 
extend it though; some of the following would be good (and might be
included in the future):

- More options for customising the GUI, either before or during runtime.
This could include; changing the size of the axes (removing completely
or changing how it is displayed), changing the font size...

- Redisplay button - when the mesh has been edited (outside the application)
it can be reread without having to restart the code.

- Full editing of the blocks. This is the ultimate aim; whether I get there
depends on a lot of things (my time and percieved demand for this).
Some of the structure to do this is already in place; everything is on
linked lists now, so could be modified, extended or deleted as appropriate.


6. Caveat emptor.

I've written this code to fill a perceived need for a simple viewer
for blockMesh files. It works for me. Your mileage may vary.
